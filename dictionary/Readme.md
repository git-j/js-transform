ODE dictionary for the project

beware, when not using consistently, the code stored in the database IS NOT in sync with the filesystem
read all your commited code carefully, reimport often, always generate & git status before touching code,
otherwise you may not be able to identify the difference git <> db
requires compiled ODABA in system/sys and 'terminology' for generating the code
